# chest-X_Ray-classification

This project involves detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model classifies images into COVID-19, pneumonia, or normal.

## What I Did
- Built and trained a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Applied data preprocessing and augmentation for robustness.
- Evaluated performance using validation accuracy and loss.
- Documented model results and observations in Jupyter notebooks.

## Files
- DIP_1.ipynb, DIP_2.ipynb: Code notebooks with model implementation.
- Outputs.pdf: Sample results and model metrics.
- Documentation.pdf, CNN and Why CNN.pdf: Explanation of architecture and logic.
